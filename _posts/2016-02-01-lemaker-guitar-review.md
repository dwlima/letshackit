<a title="20160119_191023" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/energylabs/24762647165/in/dateposted-public/" data-flickr-embed="true"><img class="alignleft" src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1484/24762647165_1cff28db6d_n.jpg" alt="20160119_191023" width="180" height="320" /></a>

So I few weeks ago I received a¬†**<a href="http://www.lemaker.org/product-guitar-index.html" target="_blank">LeMaker Guitar</a>¬†**board that I won on a <a href="http://www.lemaker.org/project/index/project_id/27.html" target="_blank">contest</a>. I got really happy about that and they sent by DHL that made everything went really fast.

As usual, in Brazil the tax everything including prizes and samples, so I got R$90 of taxes over the board. I won&#8217;t complain much about it, because it was cheap and expected.

So after some time (sorry for the long time, I got really busy üôÅ ) I managed to write this review about this board!

So talking about the board specs. This is a QuadCore ARM Cortex A9 with 1GB of RAM (a 2GB version is also available according to LeMaker).

I&#8217;m also using¬†**Lemunto for Guitar** distro, but it came with Android. I didn&#8217;t played much with android to be honest.

The Lemunto can use Oficial Ubuntu ports (that as I remember is provided by Linaro) and that is really good because we can have most packages we need. For example I wanted **rtl-sdr** to starting using it as a station:

Also I wanted to test a <a href="http://www.chalk-elec.com/?page_id=1280#!/7-open-frame-universal-HDMI-LCD-with-capacitive-multi-touch/p/21750207/category=3094861" target="_blank">7&#8221; HDMI TouchScreen from Chalk-Elec</a> that I have here on my desk. It usually works with any HDMI device, but I had some problems with Chromecast for example. But it works really fine for my LeMaker Guitar!

&nbsp;

About the performance as using it as a¬†**RTL-SDR Spectrum Server**, it was perfect. I could even sample **2.56Msps** through its 72.2Mbps wireless network (sadly **not** 5Ghz or AC network) without loss. But be noticed that I have about full signal here:`<br />
root@lemaker:~# iwconfig<br />
wlan0 IEEE 802.11bgn ESSID:"TVS" Nickname:"<WIFI@REALTEK>"<br />
Mode:Managed Frequency:2.457 GHz Access Point: 70:62:B8:6B:A6:3C<br />
Bit Rate:72.2 Mb/s Sensitivity:0/0<br />

Encryption key:****-****-****-****-****-****-****-**** Security mode:open<br />

Rx invalid nwid:0 Rx invalid crypt:0 Rx invalid frag:0<br />
Tx excessive retries:0 Invalid misc:0 Missed beacon:0<br />
`  
So it might not be enough to do a full sample rate spectrum server, but if you just want to receive NOAA, or even broadcast NOAA signal using a Spectrum Server, you can make a software do to signal decimation to reduce the sample rate to 80KHz (a decimation of 32) and increase the ADC Resolution.

For now is just that. I expect to put it to work as a SDR Spectrum Station together with my Intel Edison and see which one performs better for receiving / processing NOAA APT Signals, and maybe LRPT signals. I just expected¬†that this board came with a 5GHz / AC Wireless :/
