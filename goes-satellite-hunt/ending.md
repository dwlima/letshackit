# Ending

This is the last chapter of my GOES Satellite Hunt. For sure there will be more things that I will right about it but at least with this Article you should be able to create your own Demodulator / Decoder for LRIT signals. I still have some stuff todo, but I will post my progress here in this blog.

I would like to thank Trango \(@[usa\_satcom](https://twitter.com/usa_satcom)\) for all the help with the problems I had with Viterbi and ReedSolomon parts, and all other guys on \#hearsat that helped me to build this project. I hope you all liked this article, and stay tuned for more!

The entire working source code is at [OpenSatellite Project in github](https://github.com/racerxdl/open-satellite-project).
