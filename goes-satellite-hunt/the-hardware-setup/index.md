# So first things first. What dish should I get? {#what-dish-should-i-get}

I found some people in twitter \( More specific [@USASatcom](https://twitter.com/usa_satcom), [@uhf\_satcom](https://twitter.com/uhf_satcom) and just for historic reasons: [https://twitter.com/lucasteske/status/766484223431770112](https://twitter.com/lucasteske/status/766484223431770112) \) that did Satellite Receiving and more specifically USASatcom also did GOES receiving. And from time to time posted pictures like this:

And then I found the IRC Channel called \#hearsat in server StarChat \( irc.starchat.net \). So a lot of people actually helped me by giving me the information I need to take a decision over which dish antenna should I buy. They were suggesting a 1.2m offset dish \(same time of the Sky, Claro, and some other TV dishes, but bigger\) for receiving GOES. Sadly I couldn’t find a offset dish bigger than 90 cm here. So someone suggested that I need at least 1.5m prime focus \(the “old” type of TV dishes\) that should have equivalent surface area than a 1.2m offset dish. So I went to Santa Efigenia Street \(people from São Paulo will recognize\) and went to [SatImagem Store](http://satimagem.com.br/). Since my father and I was already friends with a seller, I asked what dishes they had to sell and said that I want something around 1.5m. He said that he has a 1.9m dish to sell.

So I bought the dish, costed about R$200 \(that’s about US$60\) and also some cables and adapters.  So since I was very excited to get things working, I asked my father’s help to assemble the antenna. I arrived home about 5 PM so it was very late to assemble the antenna. So I let it for the day after.
